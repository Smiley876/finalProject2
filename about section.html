                <p class="lead" style="color: aliceblue;">She was the kind of girl who never needed to fill the silence with words.<br>
                     Quiet, observant, and gentle, she often faded into the background where she could watch the world unfold around her.<br>
                      While others rushed to speak, she listened. <br>
                      Her calm presence carried a softness that <span class="drew">drew</span> people in, though she rarely sought attention. <br>
                      Beneath her quiet nature, however, was a thoughtful mind and a heart that noticed details most people overlooked.</p>
